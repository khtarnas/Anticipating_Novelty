# Set-up Instructions:

2. Run '''npm install''' in both the client and server folders to generate a node_modules folder in each based on their respective package.json files.
3. Run '''npm run dev''' in server folder and leave running
4. Run '''npm start''' in the client folder -- the link should automatically pop up, but if not, navigate [here](https://pages.github.com/).
